  <h4>What went well</h4>
  <p>Dividing the tasks went ok.</p>
  <h4>What could be improved</h4>
  <p>Communication could be improved. I think that many people in group work are afraid to speak up about issues, problems or in these times if they are lacking the motivation to work to a schedule. The lack of visibility along with the communication makes it more difficult to understand what everyone’s challenges are. I have found this has been much harder with online study compared to physically attending university.</p>
  <h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
  <p>Only surprise was that some group members did not want to divide tasks earlier to cater to their strengths. </p>
  <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
  <p>Personally, I didn’t learn anything I didn’t already know. I’m in my last semester as a university student and a decade older than the other group members who are at the start of there journey. It was not very surprising to have the answers I have above as they are common in many groups I have had.</p>

  <h3>Darien</h3>
  <p>The work distribution was alright as each member of the group had evenly distributed work as well as the team leader, constantly making sure messaging and asking if we have completed our work. However the group needs to improve a lot as a schedule would need to be implemented as it wasn’t organised at all, and all the group members would be busy at different times and therefore making the group work harder as well as creating a group late which therefore reduced our time to actually figure out plans for the group. I would need to improve on being more organised as well as trying to communicate with the group more often and making sure that we are working as a group as well as not leaving group work to the last minute. I’m surprised everyone was able to produce their work in such a good quality with not much communication and feedback from other group members about their work.</p>

  <h4>What went well</h4>
  <p>Tasks were completed on time to a certain degree</p>
  <h4>What could be improved</h4>
  <p>There was a definite lack of motivation towards this project, especially during these circumstances of online classes, getting a head start on work was very difficult, so there could definitely be an improvement in time management, communication and effort.</p>
  <h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
  <p>That although we were quite short on time with many setbacks and shortcomings, work was able to somewhat flow and produce results, however it was also surprising to me that were was a lack of awareness of time.</p>
  <h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
  <p>That there is a significant amount of effort that needs to be dedicated in order to efficiently run a group, especially since it is unrealistic to expect every member to be thoroughly engaged, particularly during a time where physical meetings are impossible.</p>

  <h3>Sadhav</h3>
  <p>Overall, the group performed well. We were able to finish the allocated tasks in time. The only thing that lacked in the group was communication. I guess that this assignment would be done in a more effective way if the classes were face-to-face. I like the designing skills of Dylan. One thing I have learnt is that communication is the key to success for a group project.</p>

  <h3>Mark</h3>
  <p>Dylan –You were easy to speak with, and organise the assignment. I really like the way you have spoken with the group members to try and get involvement. Looking forward to improving the way we work together on the next assignment.</p>
  <p>Darien –Your individual website looked very nice. I hope you can assist with the presentation in the next assignment. I look forward to working together better on the next assignment. It would be good if you are engaged and communicate more.</p>
  <p>Sadhav –I look forward to working together better on the next assignment. The group needs more communication from you so we can get more from your strengths. </p>

  <h3>Dylan</h3>
  <p>Mark – I am very happy to have you as a part of the team as you are a particularly motivated member, showing enthusiasm towards completing the teams goals and offering to help wherever need, communication with you was not difficult, so next assignment should go swimmingly</p>
  <p>Darien – You were easy to talk about resolving issues and you definitely contributed towards the flow of this assignment towards the end, with a more stablised start next assignment i can see you being a good contributer</p>
  <p>Sadhav – Although it was fairly delayed, the work you produced was not of poor quality at all, you were also not absent from the group chat which is a sign of a good team member, looking forward to more engagementt next assignment.</p>

  <p>The group has 4 members. Overall the group was very helpful. Dylan and Mark basically are the backbone of the group, they did a lot of effort in keeping the group together and they allocated those tasks very well. The website is designed by Dylan. I am impressed by his designing. And I like the assignment 1 design of Darien’s website.</p>
