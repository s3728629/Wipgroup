  <h2>Industry Data</h2>
  <h3>1. What are the Job Titles for your group’s ideal jobs? How do each of these rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
  <p>Mark: Senior Business Analyst</p>
  <p>Dylan: Software Engineer </p>
  <p>Sadhav: Systems Accountant</p>
  <p>Darien: Cyber Security Specialist</p>
  <p>As per https://sites.rmit.edu.au/csit-careers/job-statistics/ the only job listed as an ideal job that is an in demand job is as a Software Engineer. None of the other job titles are listed. This is very likely to be because the Cyber Security Specialist is very specialised job and title. Whereas the Senior Business Analyst and Systems Accountant jobs are more to do with business and finance than purely IT.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>2. From your group’s ideal jobs, you can identify a set of skills required for these jobs (we will refer to this as your group’s required skill set). These can be divided into general skills (communication, problem solving, writing etc) and IT-specific skills (Javascript, SQL, etc).</h3>
  <p>The groups ideals jobs are quite different. There are no common skills required for all of these jobs as per the advertisements via seek. Additionally, only Dylan’s job as a Software Engineer is listed on the website and it’s the most in demand. In terms of general skills, its not a term the website lists. In has professional skills, specialised skills and software and programming skills. So, we are not able to identify a set of skills for these jobs as they are all different. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>2.1. How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h3>
  <p>Again, only Dylan’s job has requirements matching up with the burning glass data on the website. His advertisement asks for experience in Java, Python and JavaScript which are ranked as 2nd, 3rd and 4th in demand under software and programming skills. None of the others make the list.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>2.2. How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers? </h3>
  <p>If general skills mean, the professional skills on the website then communication skills in listed number 1. </p>
  <p>In terms of our ideal jobs, the Senior Business Analyst and Systems Accountant asked for strong communication skills. The Cyber Security Specialist does not mention it. While Software Engineer has it as a minimum requirement that you can communicate in English. </p>
  <p>An interesting observation that the two jobs that are not focused on IT have more of a demand for communication.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>2.3. What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3>
  <p>The three highest ranked software and programming skills are SQL, Java and JavaScript. Only Dylan’s ideal job has 2 of these required. SQL is not required for the Software Engineer role he was interested in.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>2.4. What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set? </h3>
  <p>The three highest ranked professional skills are communication skills, problem solving and planning. These are all required for Senior Business Analyst role. These are not mentioned at all for Software Engineer or Cyber Security Specialist.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>3. Having looked at your updated Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
  <p>No, it has not. The groups ideal jobs are all aspirational and will require experience and work to get there. Additionally, the burning glass data has so many factors such as the demand in some states compared to the others, skills required being professional, specialised or software and programming skills. Many of these things will change and have changed and there is always the possibility of working outside Australia and New Zealand. We are all at different stages with our studies too. Meaning there is potentially more time to pass for some, than others to start to have the minimum requirements for the ideal jobs. Its very likely in time, the ideal jobs would change. This could be due to the demand, skills, geography or could be working in IT or another role and taking a different career path.</p>
