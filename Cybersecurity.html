  <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
  <h3>What does it do?</h3>
  <p>Cybersecurity prevents cyberattacks that wants to access, change or destroy, sensitive information that is obtained through networks and protected systems and could be used to disrupt a business or to extort an individual. The future depends on cybersecurity as big antivirus companies was first established in 1990s to battle the malware caused by individual who were able to create programs that could potentially harm the individuals’ personal systems, which the issue was content until 2014 which large and well organised attacks have been carried out on major companies thus invoking new innovative and new methods to prevent it from occurring again such as artificial intelligence searching for strange behaviours, like an unusual password activity which could have been changed by a random individual, therefore prompting the actual user to change their password. Cybersecurity has to battle different types of cyberattacks such as ransom which is a malicious software, created to extort money by not allowing the user to access the files or their system until the ransom is paid and even if it got paid, it is still not guaranteed that the user will have his files/system returned; Phishing is when a user receives an email that is similar to big companies, in order to steal data such as credential details and login information, and this is the most common cyberattack; Malware is a software which consists of codes that can infect a system to get access or to damage the system or network; Social engineering is a trick in order to get the individual to revealing sensitive information which can be used with the previous cyberattacks mentioned. These all have been prevented through programs developed throughout many years which they are being constantly produced or updated such as using antivirus or antispyware software or even both to prevent any risks of getting harmful malware but most technology have a firewall which is a network security device that determines whether to block the website based on the security rules determined. Firewall is considered the first line of defence in network security for over 25 years as it maintains a barrier between secured and controlled networks that is trusted and filters malicious websites for the user. Another cybersecurity method is cloud technology which more businesses and government agencies are using, which vital information is stored online but with the help of many programs like virtualised intrusion detection and prevention systems as well as virtualised system and hardware authentication is also present which predicts if the user is allowed to access the program or not and if the program identifies that the user is trying to access the program or website in an suspicious way then they would not be allowed to access. Businesses and individuals in current society and future ones are investing a lot more to upgrade their cybersecurity for example Australia is investing $230 million dollars into a 4 year plan to improve cybersecurity to battle the cyberattacks that is constantly causing threats and becoming more dangerous as current society advances so does the malicious software produced. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
  <p>The potential impact of this development would mean more businesses and individuals would be safer as technology advances as well as up-to-date counter measures against cyberattacks however if cybersecurity is constantly updating, cyberattacks would be more rare but it would be more dangerous as programs to battle those methods of cyberattacks would be more difficult to detect and produce a method of prevention. Large businesses would hire a lot of cybersecurity trained individuals in order to produce software or prevent cyberattacks. This would mean that there is a lot of cybersecurity jobs opened as it is hard to find an applicant who is trained in this field, but in the future there would be many more users who would be trained in this field, as cyberattacks are dangerous which would require many individuals to help battle the malicious software and the jobs in this field would be high-paying jobs as it requires a lot of creative and smart individuals to detect malicious software or produce a software to help protect the business. </p>
  <br>
  <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
  <p>Cybersecurity would affect me as it would mean I would need to be investing in cybersecurity software in order to keep my data safe from individuals with harmful intent as I use technology on a daily basis and if a disease outbreak occurs then it would mean I would be using technology extensively, therefore malware protection software is needed to protect myself from malicious software. There would no difference for me as cybersecurity has always influenced me to be careful when using the web and making sure I do not download suspicious programs that would potentially harm my technology in any way possible as well as keeping my software up to date on a daily basis to ensure that I’m safe. Cybersecurity will not have an affect on my friends and family as they are either not that technology based reliant, therefore having a minimal digital footprint  as well as the members who are technology heavy users have been educated in cybersecurity to keep themselves safe from unwanted dangers.</p>
