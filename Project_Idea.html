  <h2>Our Project Idea</h2>
  <h4>We think this project will be potentially viable as the future is moving into an era of greater technological development thus needing new ideas to make the lives of users as easy as possible and efficient as possible. This is also a good opportunity to produce a program that is user friendly compared to other programs which are confusing to navigate around.</h4>
  <h3>Overview: </h3>
  <p>A simple overview of the project we have decided on is that it will be a public transport companion application, the purpose of this app is that it will assist the user by providing the service of a digital ticket such as Myki through digital pay services such as Samsung pay and google pay which will provide a quality of life benefit to it’s users. In addition to cardless ticketing, the application will feature forms of organisation and assistance tools to provide the user with the ability to easily plan their travels in advance, provide visual mapping, reminders and time organisation features just to name a few.</p>
  <h3>Motivation: </h3>
  <p>Public transport is an essential service provided to the greater community which is used by everyone from varying categories such as the high working class to students attending high school or even primary school. According to a recent report from PTV, over 1 million people touch on to public transport daily with as many as 605 million trips taken in a year, with this service being so widely used and required it is a great area to invest in creating a mobile application which can appeal to a majority of these daily public transport users, as we live in a modern age where android and apple phones are found in the pocket of nearly every individual.</p>
  <h3>Description: </h3>
  <p>The project is in the interest of mobile technology, we are particularly intrigued by wireless technology such as wi-fi, Bluetooth and NFC which will be explored within this application. we are also intrigued by the usage and variance of wireless card machinery in all forms such as banking and not just through public transport cards such as opal and myki. An end goal would be a way to unify all forms of physical cards into one application streamlining and modernising the whole process and working towards truly innovative usage of these applications through smartwatches or possibly transplanted machinery onto the front of the palm!</p>
  <p>This project aims to contain two major features and 3-4 minor organisational features, those being a majorly featuring the ability to use the phone’s NFC feature to act as a digital ticket for public transport purposes, similarly to the already available myki. The second major feature is the ability to plan and save journeys based on the user’s input, as well as the ability to recommend new travel destinations based on previous journey inputs. In terms of minor features, the application will contain some quality of life organisational tools that are not exclusively related to public transport, those being an in built note taker, reminder based calendar, public transport medium time remaining reminder which will inform the user of the expected time until the next bus or train arrives at their nearest stop or platform as well as at their planned departure area displayed on their upcoming journey.</p>
  <p>Discussing the first major feature, the usage of wireless chip-based travel cards is commonplace in the fields of banking and public transport, so this application aims to simplify the clutter of many physical cards amongst one another by implementing the ability to store all travel cards in one unified and secure place within your very own mobile phone. And the cards can be used as they would normally through the NFC feature of modern smartphones, allowing you to securely touch on and off or even increase the balance of your account through simply holding you phone near a specified receiver.</p>
  <p>Secondly, the application is planned to contain a feature called “Journey diary” although the name is subject to change. The journey diary will be able to log all past destinations travelled to with the help of the mapping features that will be implemented alongside, as well as containing recommendations for new areas around those already travelled frequently. However the main feature of journey diary will be the ability to plan your trip in advance, showcasing the fastest route with all forms of public transport or a specific medium if that is what the user would like, it should feature time taken between each medium as well as a general estimate for how long the overall journey would take. </p>
  <h3>Tools and Technologies: </h3>
  <p>In order to run the application a modern smartphone running recent versions of android are the preferred and planned target users, although apple iPhones/iPads are definitely feasible. A recommended minimum in terms of device hardware would be a phone such as the Nexus 5, while containing the ability to use NFC is essential to use the digital ticket it will not cause issues with the other features offered. Software that will be required during the development and implementation of this application is simply android studio, however as the project progresses there may be newer software used to streamline the development process.</p>
  <h3>Skills Required: </h3>
  <p> When it comes to requirements for this project, technical skills include the ability to comfortably program using mobile languages such as Java and implement those languages into developing with a program such as android studio, due to the amount of assistance android studio provides as well as its lack of costs to download and use it is a reasonable method of development. Special hardware that may be needed is a decently powerful computer with and medium to high range processor and plenty of RAM available should the developers decide to use a virtual phone to test the application. However, should the developer’s computer be lacklustre, testing phones will be available varying in screen sizes, hardware capabilities and operating systems. Due to the low requirements of the development team as well as the hardware required it is not unreasonable to expect the specifications stated above.</p>
  <h3>Outcome: </h3>
  <p>Should this project be successful it will be a main competitor to the already available PTV and Myki mobile services available, allowing travellers to combine both features into one compact application. The features provided in the application should allow customers to plan their trips days in advance and allow the ability to reschedule should any unseen events or disruptions appear providing them with adequate time to reschedule or provide alternate routes that may be unaffected. These features should solve some issues of newer public transport users getting lost as well as inspiring public transport veterans to venture into new areas. This may increase time users spend on public transport which in turn is a benefit for recommendation of the app as well as time spent using it.</p>
